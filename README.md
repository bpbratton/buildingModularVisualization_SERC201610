# buildingModularVisualization_SERC201610

This is a simple repository used to demonstrate the power of both version control and incremental advances in visualizing a model. It was originally a problem set taught in BioMath Bootcamp 2015 (http://brodywiki.princeton.edu/wiki/index.php/MathBootCampFall2015) and further developed as an example during the SERC Workshop: Teaching Computation in the Sciences Using MATLAB (http://serc.carleton.edu/matlab_computation2016/index.html).
